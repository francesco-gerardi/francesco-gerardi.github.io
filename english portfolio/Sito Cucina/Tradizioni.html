Knowing the history of traditional Italian cuisine, its changes, its roots, is a fundamental step in the training of a professional chef.

                Traditional Italian cuisine <br> has been appreciated worldwide, and its products of great taste and genuineness have received various accolades. Indeed, many Italian products can boast the DOCG certification (controlled and guaranteed designation of origin). <br><br>
                
                The dishes that have made the history of Italian cuisine are humble, simple dishes, prepared with very few ingredients. In contrast, traditional Italian recipes are many, just as varied are the regional reinterpretations. Eating well and with quality are characteristics that have always defined the way of conceiving food. <br><br>
                
                There are many foods today that are part of our culinary heritage but have American origins: potatoes, corn, tomatoes are just a few examples of products not native to our territory but now indispensable to us.
                
                Today, it is the traditional recipes, the simple ones, those of our grandmothers that make the history of Italian cuisine. Genuine resources such as cheeses, milk, meat, oil, wine are just some of the most renowned products of Italian cuisine. It is precisely on the typical dishes of Italian culinary tradition that the dietary rules of our Mediterranean Diet are based, in the List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.</p></td>

            <td headers="col1">Over time the influences have been more and more interesting. Just think of the fact that Italian gastronomy is characterized by ingredients that are not historically indigenous to our territory, such as tomatoes or potatoes.

                The discovery of the New World was crucial, introducing new possibilities and flavours, in addition to those already mentioned we can also remember peppers and corn, initially seen with suspicion but shortly after, around the 17th century, they forcefully entered Italian cuisine destined to be considered traditional .
                One of the most important characteristics of Italian gastronomy is its diversity. This multiplicity and these differences are favored by the geography of the peninsula which, extending from north to south, encounters substantial changes in the territory, climate and habitats.
                
                But it is above all a traditional Mediterranean cuisine that is considered typically Italian and appreciated on a global level, so much so that it convinced UNESCO to include it in the intangible heritage of humanity in 2010.</td>
